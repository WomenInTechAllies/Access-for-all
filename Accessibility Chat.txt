18:10:07 From  Marcelle Pulley  to  Everyone : I literally was in an Intro to DevOps class this afternoon
18:12:21 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : Congrats!
18:12:39 From  Jim Morgan  to  Everyone : A discussion about anti-inclusive experiences people have had with Agile/Scrum/Kanban/DevOps would be useful to me as an Agile Coach
18:15:02 From  Michelle Wright  to  Everyone : Colorblind!
18:17:16 From  Cheryl Klein  to  Everyone : I use a tool Datawrapper & they include a colorblind check in the final visualization of the chart/map you are creating.
18:17:19 From  Michelle Wright  to  Everyone : "Click Here" for all links on a page
18:18:14 From  Lenore Montalbano  to  Everyone : I taught a web design class and accessibility was a part of the curriculum but nothing specific as to how to design for improved accessibility
18:26:49 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : Maybe that comes from the Apple minimalist look?
18:27:39 From  Lenore Montalbano  to  Everyone : it depends on the demographic they are designing for, my students have no problem with contrast but I as an older person need a more discernable contrast.
18:27:49 From  Cheryl Klein  to  Everyone : Love It!  My iPhone font is larger than the factory setting & it messes things up soooo often!  
18:29:44 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : I really like using the Color Oracle app for checking for checking color blind friendly content: https://colororacle.org/
18:30:37 From  marialamardo  to  Everyone : I use this one a lot too: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
18:30:58 From  marialamardo  to  Everyone : They also have this one for the 3:1 link contrast: https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF

18:47:00 From  Deb  to  Everyone : What companies do all of you work for that have the budget for this level of accessibility?
18:47:52 From  Deb  to  Everyone : Also wondering about legal considerations for not doing it.

18:51:31 From  marialamardo  to  Everyone : https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input
18:51:38 From  marialamardo  to  Everyone : On Input Criteria
18:52:00 From  marialamardo  to  Everyone : @deb I work at CVS Health
18:52:38 From  Michelle Wright  to  Everyone : It usually takes law suits
18:52:58 From  Deb  to  Everyone : As the developer, am_I_ liable?
18:53:19 From  Cheryl Klein  to  Everyone : Some universities are really good about it.
18:53:23 From  Kimberly Burnett  to  Everyone : Are there aspects to accessibility that are most / least important to focus on
18:53:34 From  Susan Wands  to  Everyone : https://medium.com/@krisrivenburgh/the-ada-checklist-website-compliance-guidelines-for-2019-in-plain-english-123c1d58fad9
18:53:42 From  Deb  to  Everyone : Thanks!
18:53:55 From  Michelle Wright  to  Everyone : It's challenging as well because the guidelines are vague and offer multiple ways to satisfy accessibility - definitions of what is acceptable differ
18:54:18 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : I work at NC State (as a researcher) and they have dedicated staff for web accessibility.
18:54:42 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : In office of information technologies.
18:55:26 From  Deb  to  Everyone : My client is a flight school, and the students as pilots can't be blind for example, so I can see that they don't need the site to work well with a screen reader
18:55:58 From  Michelle Wright  to  Everyone : We did a major project for an online elementary-high school because state laws required accessibility
18:56:04 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : Universities also have to abide by equal access to education so my thought is that’s why they have so much support.
18:57:18 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : From what I’ve heard from NC State web accessibility staff is that they always try to air on accessibility b/c legally it’s still early days for digital accessibility.
18:57:19 From  Kimberly Burnett  to  Everyone : What are some of the easy wins, or highest priority things to focus on first if you want to gradually make things more accessible?
18:57:47 From  Lenore Montalbano  to  Everyone : So HTML5 is more compatible with accessibility then?
18:57:48 From  Deb  to  Everyone : Good point
18:59:23 From  Jim Morgan  to  Everyone : I found that just by reading through the WCAG document taught me a lot of easy changes I could do as I designed the site
18:59:51 From  Lenore Montalbano  to  Everyone : If I am building a Razor page which is interpreted as HTML5 then the potential for accessibility is better, correct?
19:00:15 From  Deb  to  Everyone : What do you think about the dislexia font?  https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/
19:00:15 From  Sheila Saia  to  Everyone : I have to go but it was great to learn from you all! Thanks a bunch. :D

19:08:13 From  Jim Morgan  to  Everyone : Are there any websites or WordPress plugins that will check a site for accessibility? I've looked for plugins without any luck

19:22:01 From  Jim Morgan  to  Everyone : I hate to tell you, but was having that problem with designers 25 years ago, when the issue was called "human factors!"
19:24:48 From  Jim Morgan  to  Everyone : Usually I find the button won't work because I am blocking trackers they have associated with it
